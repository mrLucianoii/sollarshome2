						<p>
							Sollars Home™ is dedicated to providing a seamless experience for our clients.  Thus, we have three relationship models to service your needs.  The first relationship model is where we work directly with you alone.  In this role, Sollars Home designs and builds your project from start to finish.  We are a single point of contact, and offer the pinnacle of responsibility, accountability, and transparency.
						</p>
						<p>
					The second relationship model is one in which you have already selected an architect.  In this case, your architect will provide the design, and Sollars Home would act in the role of the general contractor to build your architect’s design.  In our capacity as the general contractor, we would work with the structural engineer to produce the structural plans, and then work under the guidance of the architect to produce a home to the plans as designed.
						</p>
						<p>
The third relationship model is one in which you have both an architect and a builder you are comfortable with, but you wish to have a house built with concrete rather than with wood.  In this case, Sollars Home would act in the role of the structural subcontractor.  Sollars Home would provide the concrete shell and interior wood frame for the project, built to the plans provided by the architect.  After the shell has been constructed, our role would be done, and your builder would take over and finish the home. 					 						</p>
						<p>
							Below is an overview explaining the typical process by which a project is implemented from conception through completion.  When we work directly with you as a design/build contractor (the first relationship model), all 6 phases are applicable.  If you have an architect who designs the building (the second relationship model), we will assist your architect, but your architect assumes responsibility for Phase 2 (Design) and Phase 3 (Permits).  If you have an architect and a builder and we only supply the shell, your architect is responsible for Phases 2 and 3, and your builder is responsible for Phase 5 (Finish) and Phase 6 (Site Accessories and Landscaping).
						</p></br>
						
						<h2>TYPICAL FLOW FOR A SOLLARS HOME PROJECT</h2>
						<h3>Phase 1: Budget and Contract</h3>
						<p>
						We provide free in home estimates where a design consultant comes to your residence, listens to your wants and needs, goes over design options, and provides preliminary budget numbers. In about a  week, you will be given a detailed estimate for your project. 		
						</p>
						<p>
We will work to narrow down figures that fit within your budget to give you exactly what you are after. Follow up consultations are provided as needed until we reach mutually agreeable terms such that a contract can be signed.
						</p>		
						<h3>Phase 2: Design</h3>
						<p>
							We have residential designers, architects, and engineers ready to assist with your project. A Sollars Home is built using a high level of construction technology, therefore, 3D renderings of the project are the basis for our work. We have found that there are clearer expectations and less discrepancies when our clients can visually see what the blueprints are going to create.  It is even possible to 3D print your design (additional costs apply) so that you can hold a model of your new Sollars Home in your hands!
						</p>
						<p>
							A simulation of the construction process is done as a part of the design phase to better understand what our clients are after. Thus, we are able to solve problems before they even exist; making for a prompt and hassle free experience. 
						</p>
						<h3>Phase 3: Permits</h3>
						<p>
						Once a design is completed and has received your approval, the plans are submitted to the appropriate jurisdiction for permit. This can be the most painful and frustrating portion of the project because it is out of our control. The length of time to obtain a permit will depend upon the nature and size of the project.  You can count on Sollars Home to respond promptly to all requests that the permitting jurisdiction makes such that your project proceeds as rapidly as possible.	
						</p>
						<h3>Phase 4: Cast the Sollars Home</h3>
						<p>
							The interior wood frame is prefabricated based upon the results of the simulation that was performed in the design phase.  The same is true for the rough plumbing, rough electrical, and rough HVAC systems.  When we mobilize for your project, these pieces will arrive on a truck, along with a custom kit of Multi-Flex Forms, ready for installation by our technicians.
						</p>
						<p>
						We use surveying technology to verify that we are completing our project according to plan.  After the site has been prepared by our grading and excavating crew, the Multi-Flex Formwork for your project is ready to be installed.  Reinforcing steel bars are set in place along with the interior wood frame. Then, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC components for the entire building are fixed in their appropriate locations and verified.  The entire process takes between 2 and 5 weeks depending upon the size and complexity of the structure. 	
						</p>
						<p>
						Once all required components have been inspected and verified, the entire building is cast in a single pour.  The interior formwork must be left in place until the concrete hardens, which takes about a week.  During this time, the exterior of the casting is finished and doors and windows are installed such that the building looks livable from the outside 	
						</p>
						<h3>Phase 5: Finish the Sollars Home</h3>
						<p>
							After 7 to 10 days, depending upon the season, the concrete has hardened sufficiently to allow us to take the interior formwork down and finish out the building with all of the craftsmanship you would come to expect in a fine home.  The concrete slab is polished (if applicable), and we install the non-structural  interior walls.  Insulation is then installed, followed immediately by drywall and then paint.  The interior finishings are then installed followed by the electrical and plumbing fixtures.  Interior trim and flooring are the final trades to be completed and your Sollars Home is ready!
						</p>
						<h3>Phase 6: Site Accessories and Landscaping</h3>
						<p>
						At this point, your Sollars Home has been completed, and for some homeowners, this would signal the end of the project.  For most projects though, there will be site accessories and landscaping to be installed.  Examples of site accessories would be swimming pools, spas, patios, decks, pergolas, fountains, and retaining walls.  Examples of landscaping work would be trees, shrubs, flowers, and lawns.  It is often possible to begin working on the site accessories and landscaping phase of the project while the interior of your Sollars Home is being completed.  Once these features are completed, it is time to turn over the keys and you can begin to enjoy your new Sollars Home!
